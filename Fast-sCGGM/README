Usage: ./fast_scggm [options] Y_output_samples Y_output_dims X_input_samples X_input_dims Y_file X_file Lambda_file Theta_file stats_file
    sparse Lambda and Theta format (1-based array indices):
num_rows num_columns num_nonzeros
row_1 column_1 value_1
...
row_{num_nonzeros} column_{num_nonzeros} value_{num_nonzeros}
    options:
-y lambda_y(0.5): set the regularization parameter lambda_y
-x lambda_x(0.5): set the regularization parameter lambda_x
-v verbose(1): show information or not (0 or 1)
-i max_outer_iters(10): max number of outer iterations
-q tol(1e-2): tolerance for terminating outer loop
-s sigma(1e-4): backtracking termination criterion
-L Lambda0_filename: filename with initial Lambda0
-T Theta0_filename: filename with initial Theta0
-r refit(0): update (Lambda0,Theta0) without adding edges (0 or 1)

Data should be represented as matrices Y (output variable data, 
eg gene expression levels) and and X (input variable data, eg genotypes) 
and stored in text files. The software reads the data stored in Y_file and X_file,
the filenames for Y and X, respectively.
Each line should contain the data for one individual,
with values separated by whitespace (ie tabs or spaces). 
The sizes of matrices Y and X also must be specified, as Y_output_samples 
and Y_output_dims, and X_input_samples and X_input_dims, respectively.

Upon completion, Fast-sCGGM writes three outputs: Lambda 
(estimated network parameters over output variables), Theta (estimated input-output 
perturbation parameters), and a file containing statistics, such as the value of 
the objective function over the algorithm iterations. 
The paths and filenames of these outputs must be specified by the user,
as Lambda_file, Theta_file, and stats_file.

The estimated model parameters are given in sparse matrix format.
These are stored in text files, with three columns (separated by spaces) 
and nnz lines, where nnz is the number of non-zeros in each matrix.
The first line of Lambda_file and Theta_file contain three numbers 
about the estimated parameter matrices:  
num_rows num_columns num_nonzeros
This is followed by num_nonzeros lines, each of which describes a single 
non-zero element in the sparse matrix with its row index, column index, 
and value. Row and column indices are given in base-1, thus taking values 
within the range from 1 to num_rows or num_columns, respectively.

The regularization parameters are optional inputs to the command-line software,
lambda_y for Lambda, the output network parameters, and lambda_x for Theta,
the input-output perturbation parameters. We recommend that users try 
running our software with multiple different settings of these parameters. 

Several algorithm control parameters can be used to manually adjust the runtime 
and precision of the method. 
- max_outer_iters limits the number of iterations
  of the algorithm, where each iteration updates both Lambda and Theta.
- tol is the termination criterion, allowing the program to 
  finish before reaching max_outer_iters if the criterion is satisfied. The 
  algorithm terminates when the minimum-norm subgradient becomes less than 
  tol times the L1-norm of the parameters. This roughly corresponds to the 
  number of significant digits of precision (eg tol=1e-2 terminates at 
  2 significant digits of accuracy).
- sigma is the backtracking line-search parameter for Lambda, 
  and must be greater than 0 and less than 0.5. Larger values require more 
  backtracking steps, but produce larger decreases in the objective function. 
  However, we recommend keeping sigma very close to 0, due to the time cost 
  of line-search.

Fast-sCGGM by default initializes Lambda to a diagonal matrix and 
Theta to all-zeros. But a user may instead specify different initializations 
by writing the initial parameters to files and passing in the path/filenames 
as Lambda0_file and Theta0_file, respectively. The formats of these files 
is the same as described above for Lambda_file and Theta_file.

If the user provides Lambda0_file and Theta0_file, the refit option may 
be set to 1. This re-estimates Lambda and Theta without any regularization,
while preventing the addition of further edges. We recommend users only use
this on problems where the number of samples is comparable to the number of 
output dimensions and input dimension, or where the provided Lambda0 and 
Theta0 are extremely sparse. Otherwise, overfitting will likely occur.
